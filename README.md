Project: Credit card fraud detection

Objective :

The objective of credit card fraud detection is to identify and prevent unauthorized transactions in real-time. It aims to protect consumers from financial loss and maintain trust in financial institutions. By analyzing transaction patterns and behaviors, the system seeks to distinguish between legitimate and fraudulent activities. The goal is to minimize false positives while effectively flagging suspicious transactions. Ultimately, it enhances overall security and reduces operational costs for banks and merchants.

Key Activites :

Data Gathering: Collecting historical transaction data, including information on fraudulent and legitimate transactions.
Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, outliers, and ensuring data quality for effective modeling.
Feature Engineering: Creating meaningful features from raw data, such as transaction amount patterns, location frequency, or timing of transactions.
Data Transformation: Scaling numerical features and encoding categorical variables to make them suitable for machine learning algorithms.
Data Balancing: Addressing class imbalance (fraudulent vs. non-fraudulent transactions), using techniques like oversampling, undersampling, or synthetic data generation (e.g., SMOTE).

Technologies used :

Data Processing and Management
Machine learning Algorithms and Frameworks
Real-time Data Processing
Feature Engineering and Anomaly Detection
Model Depolyment and Monitoring
Data Security and Compliance
Feedback and Contionous learning
